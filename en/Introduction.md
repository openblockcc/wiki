# Introduction to OpenBlock

OpenBlock is a powerful graphical programming software developed based on Scratch 3.0. It not only supports a variety of open-source hardware but also runs on multiple operating systems. The highlight of OpenBlock is its compatibility with Arduino and MicroPython programming frameworks, and it can communicate with control boards in real-time via protocols such as Firmata, making the programming process simpler and more intuitive. Whether you are a programming beginner or an experienced expert, OpenBlock can meet your needs and extend your creativity.

## OpenBlock: A Fun and Interactive Graphical Programming Software

Do you want your child to learn the basic concepts and skills of programming while having fun? Do you want your child to use their creativity to control various open-source hardware such as Arduino, Micro:bit, ESP32, etc.? Do you want your child to experience the joy and sense of achievement that comes with programming? If your answer is yes, then you must check out OpenBlock, a graphical programming software specifically designed for children's STEM education.

## What are the Features and Advantages of OpenBlock?

- OpenBlock is a free open-source software. You can download the latest version on Wiki, or view the source code and documentation on GitHub.
  
- OpenBlock uses a graphical programming interface where you can build your programs by dragging and dropping different blocks, eliminating the need to input complex code. This makes it very suitable for programming beginners and children.

- OpenBlock supports a variety of open-source hardware such as Arduino, Micro:bit, ESP32, ESP8266, K210, etc. You can use OpenBlock to control the input and output of these hardware components, such as LED lights, sensors, motors, buzzers, etc., to create interesting projects like smart cars, thermometers, electronic pianos, etc.

- OpenBlock supports both Arduino and MicroPython programming frameworks. This means you can use OpenBlock to write Arduino or MicroPython code and upload it to your hardware without the need to install additional software.

- OpenBlock provides rich tutorials and examples. You can view them on the official website or YouTube to learn how to use OpenBlock to complete various interesting projects or refer to other users' works to inspire your creativity.

- OpenBlock has an open plugin system, allowing advanced users and developers to write and add new control boards and modules themselves.

## How to Start Using OpenBlock?

To start using OpenBlock, you only need the following items:

- A computer with Windows, Mac, or Linux system.
- An open-source hardware component such as Arduino UNO, Micro:bit, ESP32, ESP8266, etc., along with the corresponding cables and accessories.
- Download and install the OpenBlock software. You can download the latest version on Wiki.
- Connect your hardware to the computer, open the OpenBlock software, select your hardware type, and start programming!

## What Can OpenBlock Do?

The possibilities with OpenBlock are only limited by your imagination. You can use it to create various interesting projects such as smart cars, thermometers, electronic pianos, and even gaming consoles. Below are some example projects you can find more tutorials and videos on the official website or YouTube.

- [Making a Smart Car with OpenBlock and Arduino]: This project will teach you how to use OpenBlock and Arduino to make a remote-controlled smart car. You can control the car's forward, backward, left turn, right turn, and speed with OpenBlock. You can also use sensors to detect the car's distance and obstacles, enabling the car to avoid obstacles automatically.

- [Making a Thermometer with OpenBlock and Micro:bit]: This project will teach you how to use OpenBlock and Micro:bit to make a thermometer. You can use OpenBlock to read data from the temperature sensor on the Micro:bit and display the temperature using LED lights or an LCD screen. You can also use a buzzer to emit different sounds to indicate temperature levels.

- [Making an Electronic Piano with OpenBlock and ESP32]: This project will teach you how to use OpenBlock and ESP32 to make an electronic piano. You can use OpenBlock to control the buzzer on the ESP32 to produce different tones and use buttons or touchpads to trigger different notes. You can also use LED lights to display the colors of the notes, creating a colorful electronic piano.

- [Making a Gaming Console with OpenBlock and ESP8266]: This project will teach you how to use OpenBlock and ESP8266 to make a gaming console. You can use OpenBlock to write the game logic and interface, then use the OLED screen on the ESP8266 to display the game graphics. You can also use buttons or joysticks to control the game characters, creating a mini gaming console.

## OpenBlock Version Information

OpenBlock maintains and releases two versions of the software, both of which are free. The Community Edition code is fully open-source, while the Release Edition adds multi-framework programming and a more open external plugin system based on the Community Edition. For regular users, DIY enthusiasts, and hardware manufacturers, we recommend using the Release Edition.

| Version | Community Edition | Release Edition |
| :----: | :---- | :---- |
| License | Open source, MIT license | Closed source, proprietary license |
| Target Users | Software developers | Regular users, DIY enthusiasts, hardware manufacturers |
| Cost | Free | Free |
| External Plugins | Supported | More features |
| Programming Frameworks | Arduino, MicroPython (only supports Micro:bit) | Arduino, MicroPython (Supports ESP32, ESP8266, K210, Raspberry Pi Pico, etc.) |

In the Release Edition, you can experience convenient programming framework switching and more powerful plugin features, providing endless possibilities for your creations and adding more powerful functions to your products.
