# Localization

## Introduction

OpenBlock manages translation content through [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/), where `OpenBlock-Editor` covers translations for the editor interface and core content such as blocks, while `OpenBlock-Extensions` pertains to translations for officially maintained external plugins.

## Join the Translation Team

You can apply to join the translation team by visiting [https://www.transifex.com/openblockcc](https://www.transifex.com/openblockcc). Once the basic translations for all projects are completed, we will add the language to the software support list. If we do not process your application promptly, please contact us via email at: [arthurzheng@openblock.cc](mailto:arthurzheng@openblock.cc).

## Adding New Languages

You can apply to add new languages at [https://www.transifex.com/openblockcc](https://www.transifex.com/openblockcc).
